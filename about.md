    <h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-text">Hello there! I'm Timothy, a software developer based in Toronto. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and journeys.</p>

    <h2 class="about-title">Background</h2>
    <p class="about-text">I come from a STEM background, with a major in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Growing up in the age of the internet has provided me with endless resources to learn about math, science, and technology. Currently, I work as a full-time technical lead for a startup.</p>

<div class="hobbies-section">
  <h1 class="hobbies-title">Hobbies</h1>
  <p class="hobbies-text">Despite being deeply immersed in STEM, I'd like to believe I'm a very creative person. You might find me playing or creating music when I'm not engaged in visual arts. </p>
  <p class="hobbies-text">In an effort to avoid withering away, I also spend time bouldering and playing all kinds of racquet sports. I don't want to lose a pushup contest with my future grandkids. </p>
</div>

<div class="recreation-section">
  <h1 class="recreation-title">Recreation</h1>
  <p class="recreation-text">I believe that video games are one of the best ways to stay connected with friends who can't meet in person. If I'm gaming, I usually spend my time on TFT, League, Tetris, chess or co-op games. My favourite all time game is It Takes Two!</p>
  <p class="recreation-text">If you're looking for a show to start, I'm currently enjoying Atypical, A Goodplace, Jujutsu Kaisen S2 and A Time Called You</p>
